## Description
This story helps us establish and verify our markdown-based agile workflow. We need to define the structure of a "User Story Card" and ensure we can track it in the backlog.

## User Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a clear, standardized user story format,
**So that** I can understand requirements, acceptance criteria, and testing steps for every task.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [X] The user story file contains all required fields: Name, Description, Points, Status.
- [X] A `User Story` section exists with standard "As a... I want... So that..." format.
- [X] A `Testing` section exists to guide verification.
- [X] A `Review` section exists for comments.
- [X] The story is added to `backlog.md`.

## Testing
1. **Verify File Structure**: Ensure this file renders correctly in Markdown.
2. **Backlog Check**: Confirm this story appears in `planning/agile/backlog.md`.
3. **Process Check**: Move this story to `DONE` once the structure is approved.
